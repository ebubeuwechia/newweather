## Git

Before using please read the following about Git and how to properly use it:
Git parable: https://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html

Github Flow: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow

Basically, there is our main branch "master"
- From there, make your own branch to do some feature of code 
    - Name the branch your name. EX: If I was adding photos. Make a new branch with the ` git branch ebube`
    - to switch between branches run `git switch <branch you are switching to>`
- Once you are finished, have commited, and pushed all your changes -> Open a Pull Request to merge your branch into 'main'
    - Pushing for the first time will likely require ` git push --set-upstream origin <branch>` to make sure the remote github origin makes a new branch for the one you made

Never directly commit onto main, always use a branch
